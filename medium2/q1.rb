# Question 1

# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for
# that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can
# be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular
# named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby everything is an object
# ...but it is not always THE SAME object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of
# the code below:

def fun_with_ints
  outer = 42
  outer_id = outer.object_id

  puts "(outside) 1. VALUE = #{outer}, OBJECT_ID = #{outer_id}\n"

  1.times do
    outer_inner_id = outer.object_id
    puts "(inside) 2. OBJECT_ID = #{outer_inner_id}\n"
    puts "The object_id is still the same inside the block"
    outer = 22
    puts "\n(inside) 3. VALUE = #{outer}, OBJECT_ID = #{outer.object_id}\n"
    puts "this creates a new object and points the name to this new object because the variable is within scope"
    inner = outer
    inner_id = inner.object_id
    puts "\n(inside) 4. VALUE = #{inner}, OBJECT_ID = #{inner_id}\n"
  end
  puts "\n(outside) 5. VALUE = #{outer}, OBJECT_ID = #{outer.object_id}\n"
